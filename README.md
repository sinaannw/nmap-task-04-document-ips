# Task 04 - Document Discovered IPs and Ports

## ✅ What I Did
- Reviewed the Nmap scan results from Task 03 (`scan_results.txt`).
- Identified the IP addresses that are live and have open ports.
- Created a summary table of active hosts and their open ports.

## 📁 Files
- `scan_results.txt`: The raw Nmap scan output.
- `ip_list.png`: Screenshot of my terminal or editor showing the IP summary.
